The final model chosen for the prediction of blind test outputs is the KNN, given that it has the best TS_MEE among several models (TS_MEE = 1.46). The best hyper-parameters are: k=15, metric= "euclidean", weights = "distance". Regarding model selection, the grid-search approach was the one used to find the best hyper-parameters. A 5-folds CV, repeated 10 times, was implemented for each cell of the grid. For model assessment we adopted an hold-out procedure: 30% test + 70% design. The metric used to select and evaluate the model is the MEE.
